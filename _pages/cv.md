Education
======
* Ph.D., Agricultural Economics, 2020 – present, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY
* Dissertation: “Essays on Extreme Weather Events: Analyzing Impacts on Agricultural and Water Resources in the United States”
* Dissertation Summary: Examines how climate-driven extremes impact U.S. agriculture and water resources. Chapter 1 shows that constructing heat-stress metrics after spatially interpolating weather data systematically understates corn-yield losses in the U.S. Corn Belt Region. Chapter 2 links extreme weather to water quality, and Chapter 3 looks at the heterogenous effects of lot size composition on residential water demand. Committee: Steven Buck (chair), Tyler Mark, Nicholas Pates, Jason Unrine
