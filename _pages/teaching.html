<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>For me, teaching is an act of connection with students. My priority is to connect students to the subject matter and to the world around them. I see economics not just as a set of graphs and equations, but as a story of our choices and their impact on our shared environment. Many students approach economics with apprehension, seeing it as something abstract or intimidating. My first goal is to remove that fear and cultivate a teaching atmosphere of inquiry and empathy, where students learn to approach complex problems not with fear, but with curiosity, compassion, and the confidence to ask challenging questions.</p>

<h2 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 3em; font-weight: 400;">Teaching Interests</h2>

<p>My teaching interests align closely with my research goals, focusing on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Environmental and Resource Economics</strong> - Climate change impacts, sustainability, and natural resource management</li>
  <li><strong>Agricultural Economics</strong> - Agricultural policy, and food systems</li>
  <li><strong>Applied Econometrics</strong> - Statistical methods for economic analysis</li>
  <li><strong>International Trade</strong> - Global agricultural markets and trade policy</li>
</ul>

<p>I am particularly interested in developing courses that integrate economic theory with environmental challenges, helping students understand how economic tools can address environmental and sustainability problems.</p>
